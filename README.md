### Description:
SSG, two languages website with animations, custom interactive cube element and dynamic routing. Two languages text data and all graphical assets are on the same server, are not fetched what was the easiest way to ensure visitors the smoothest UX at small scale. Website is SEO optimized. Dynamic routing - sub pages are generated dynamicly on base of text content which easly can be changed. YouTube videos are displaied.
Simple Nodemailer usage as a contact form.
Some code refactor to clean up a code needed... ;)

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
